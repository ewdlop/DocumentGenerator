The concept of a **direct product** being a **semidirect product** depends on the mathematical structure in question. These terms are commonly used in **group theory**, a branch of abstract algebra. Here's an explanation:

---

### **1. Direct Product**

The **direct product** of two groups \( G \) and \( H \), denoted \( G \times H \), is a group where:

1. The elements are ordered pairs \( (g, h) \) with \( g \in G \) and \( h \in H \).

2. The group operation is defined component-wise:
   \[
   (g_1, h_1) \cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1 g_2, h_1 h_2).
   \]

Properties of the direct product:

- Both \( G \) and \( H \) are **normal subgroups** of \( G \times H \).

- The direct product is **commutative** if both \( G \) and \( H \) are abelian groups.

---

### **2. Semidirect Product**

A **semidirect product** is a more general construction. It is denoted as \( G \rtimes_\phi H \), where \( H \) acts on \( G \) via a homomorphism \( \phi: H \to \text{Aut}(G) \) (a map defining how \( H \) automorphically interacts with \( G \)).

#### Group Operation:

For \( (g_1, h_1), (g_2, h_2) \in G \rtimes_\phi H \), the group operation is defined as:
\[
(g_1, h_1) \cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1 \phi(h_1)(g_2), h_1 h_2),
\]
where \( \phi(h_1)(g_2) \) is the action of \( h_1 \) on \( g_2 \) in \( G \).

Key differences:

- \( G \) is not necessarily a normal subgroup.

- The structure of \( G \rtimes_\phi H \) depends on \( \phi \), the interaction between \( G \) and \( H \).

---

### **3. Relationship Between Direct and Semidirect Products**

- The **direct product** \( G \times H \) is a **special case** of the semidirect product \( G \rtimes_\phi H \), where the action \( \phi \) is **trivial**.  
- A trivial action means \( \phi(h)(g) = g \) for all \( h \in H \) and \( g \in G \).

In this case, the semidirect product simplifies to:
\[
(g_1, h_1) \cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1 g_2, h_1 h_2),
\]
which is exactly the definition of the direct product.

---

### **4. When is a Direct Product a Semidirect Product?**

- **Always:** A direct product \( G \times H \) can always be viewed as a semidirect product \( G \rtimes_\phi H \) with the trivial action \( \phi \).

- However, not all semidirect products \( G \rtimes_\phi H \) are direct products, as the action \( \phi \) introduces non-trivial interactions.

---

### **5. Example**

#### Direct Product:

Let \( G = \mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0, 1\} \) and \( H = \mathbb{Z}_3 = \{0, 1, 2\} \).  
The direct product \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \) has elements:
\[
\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)\}.
\]
The group operation is component-wise addition modulo 2 and modulo 3.

#### Semidirect Product:

Suppose \( G = \mathbb{Z}_6 \) and \( H = \mathbb{Z}_2 \), and \( H \) acts on \( G \) by inversion:

- \( \phi(h)(g) = -g \mod 6 \) if \( h = 1 \), and \( \phi(h)(g) = g \) if \( h = 0 \).

The resulting semidirect product \( G \rtimes_\phi H \) will have non-trivial structure, as the action \( \phi \) changes the interaction between \( G \) and \( H \).

---

### **6. Conclusion**

The **direct product** is a special case of the **semidirect product** with a trivial action. This relationship highlights the broader flexibility of semidirect products in constructing new group structures.
